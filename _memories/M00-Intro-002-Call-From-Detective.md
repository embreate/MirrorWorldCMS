Each of the Protagonists memories can be found in the bin on the right. In the game the memories will haover around the periphery of the player, the more they interact with them the better chance they will bubble to the surface. This will be convenient as the more usefull memories are always close at hand but also a hinderence as they may distract from key events.   

You're staring at yourself in the mirror. You are covered in tattoos. Your memories bubble around your periphery.

This memory could be used anytime the player needs energy to overcome a difficult situation. 

Looking closely at the tattoo you see the image of a young girl floating in water her hand reaching towards the silhoette of a woman in a boat. 

A memory is triggered, you find yourself floating in the water fog rises from the surface. A man is with you, he is helping you swim. 

{:.dialogue}
YOUNG PROTAGONIST <br>Mom! Mommy!

The man holding you tries to calm you down. Other people are swimming towards you. 

{:.dialogue}
MAN <br>Honey, we must swim. Mommy doesn't know how. 

You make out the silhoette of a boat. Lights flash and you hear a siren off in the distance.

You stand up and throw on clothes. 

You walk towards the balcony. There is a sea of windows from apartments in the distance. A light flashes below the window. A small, single seated vehicle with four large propellers floats up to your window. The door slides up giving you a view of the empty cockpit. 

{:.note-story}
Might be funny if the Protagonist has a fear of flying. A memory she has of falling bubbles up at this moment. But she has no choice, unless she wants to be arrested.
