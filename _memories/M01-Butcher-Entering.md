As you hurtle down the tunnel a light in the distance fills your view. For a second you see the perspective of a man wearing an apron covered in blood, he's efficiently cutting the flesh of a pig.

You continue down the tunnel for a couple seconds and then another scene floods your view. You see the world from the perspective of a young boy cutting the neck of a lamb. Just as blood begins to seep out from the lambs neck you're taveling down the tunnel again.

Another flash of light and you're watching a man laying in a ditch bleeding out of his leg.

MAN <br>I don’t want to die.

<section markdown="1" class="memorySection">

You're traveling even faster down the tunnel. Another flash and you're inside of a nice suburban home, you see a woman covered in blood (Free Spirit) steps back away from you, her hands held out.   

{:.dialogue} 
WOMAN <br>You don’t have to do it.
