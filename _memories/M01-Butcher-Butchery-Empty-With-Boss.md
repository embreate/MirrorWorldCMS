You are alone in the Butchery with Boss. He is telling you a story.

BOSS <br>Did I ever tell you about the time I managed to get a whole shipment of ground round for free? It was something, buddyboy. That lady at the farm – what’s her name, Anne? Ya she loves me. She just needed me to tell her I thought her hair looked nice and bam! Whatever I wanted. I just told her that we were going to start giving same day off cuts to charity, andshe  bought it!  There’s a real easy way to get what you want from these older ladies, Raff. And not only that, she also believed me when I told her that I was going to need more because I wanted to do a bbq fundraiser with free burgers for the local shelter. It’s amazing what people will believe when they want to trust in the goodwill of their neighbours, boy. What are you looking at? You think you’re better than me.

BOSS <br>Get back to work. There’s nothing worse in all the world than laziness. You people who’ve served in the war think you deserve special treatment, but if you were a real man you wouldn’t jump every time I do this (slams knife down on block). You are all just lazy and looking for handouts.

RAFF <br>Leave me alone.

BOSS <br>Are you talking back to me? You have a hell of an attitude for someone who can barely do his job. Maybe you need to cool off (indicates meat freezer).

BOSS <br>You like that woman who comes in here, don’t you? It’s too bad she clearly likes the real man in here. Don’t worry, I’m not gonna go after her – she’s not my type, way too snooty. But you should just give up, guy. Women want men who can make up their minds – they  don’t want someone like you – you’re all scrambled, you can’t even remember who you are half the time.”

BOSS <br>Every time I see Elma come in here, I think about how much better looking she was when she was young.
