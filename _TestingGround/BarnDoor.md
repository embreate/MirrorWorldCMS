Hover over Open Barn Doors
If Grandad is not distracted: he will grab you and forcibly return you to your seat. And scream at you. The game will flash through the below memories in a random order and take players to the last one on the list;
Drill sergeant barking orders
The Police telling you to get on your knees after botched robbery
Wife screaming at him
If Grandad is distracted: Young Raf will escape. FPS shot running through field. Huddling amongst corn stocks. Go to memory: Night in the Trench. What he learned hiding from his grandpa came in handy while hunkering down in a trench with gunfire raged overhead.  
Untie Lamb
At this point in development I’m not sure what the challenge is. How do they distract Grandpa?
If caught by grandpa: Raf receives the largest punishment. His grandfather berates him for being weak, a loser like his father. This triggers his PTSD, even at a young age;
[View Only] Shot of his father getting high.
[View Only] His father overdosing. Raf was helpless to stop them.
[View Only] Him and his wife fighting, she tells him he’s a loser.
[View Only] The child at the murder scene, telling him that he will entrap him in his own private hell for all eternity.
Go to memory: Boss Training Him
If successful: this is the hardest thing to do and provides the player the largest reward.
He protects a classmate being bullied. They later join the army together.
